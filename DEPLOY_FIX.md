# Deployment Fix - December 18, 2024

This file forces a fresh push to GitHub to sync all corrected files.

## Changes Applied:
- Updated HomeHero.tsx to use correct Button API (removed `size` and `asChild` props)
- Replaced old color tokens (bg-primary, bg-accent, text-charcoal) with new sage palette (cvAccent, cvInk, cvMuted)
- All components now use the warm romantic sage palette

## Next Steps:
This commit will trigger a fresh deployment with all corrections in place.
