### Monday — Planning Tip

```
Planning Tip: Start budget conversations with actual numbers, not percentages.

Many couples default to "10-15% of income" formulas. A more effective approach: 
define the total you're comfortable with first, then allocate by priority.

Understanding Planning Intensives

Not every couple needs full planning support. Planning Intensives provide 
focused sessions for specific challenges: budget clarity, vendor strategy, 
or timeline development.

Sourcing from India: Timeline Considerations

If sourcing outfits or ceremony items from India, factor in 4-6 months 
for procurement, shipping, and customs clearance.

Starting earlier provides flexibility for alterations and quality issues.
